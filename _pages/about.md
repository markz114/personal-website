I am currently a Ph.D. candidate in [Electrical Engineering](https://ee.stanford.edu) at [Stanford University](https://www.stanford.edu), advised by [Christos Kozyrakis](https://web.stanford.edu/~kozyraki/).

My research centers around co-designing computer systems and hardware to improve the scalability, performance, and security of datacenter-scale applications.
I am currently working on data storage and ingestion systems to manage training data in industry-scale machine learning pipelines.
My prior research has explored accelerating video analytics pipelines and the security of cloud FPGAs.
I am supported by a [Stanford Graduate Fellowship](https://vpge.stanford.edu/fellowships-funding/sgf/details), and my work has won the [IEEE S&P Distinguished Practical Paper Award](https://www.ieee-security.org/TC/SP2018/awards.html).

I was recently a Visiting Researcher in the [FAIR](https://ai.facebook.com) and infrastructure teams at Meta from 2020-2022, where I worked on data management infrastructure for ML training.
I received my B.S. in [Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://www.ece.cornell.edu/ece) from [Cornell University](https://www.cornell.edu) in 2018, where I worked with [Ed Suh](https://tsg.ece.cornell.edu/people/g-edward-suh/) on hardware security.
