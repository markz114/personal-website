I am currently a Ph.D. candidate in [Electrical Engineering](https://ee.stanford.edu) at [Stanford University](https://www.stanford.edu), advised by [Christos Kozyrakis](https://web.stanford.edu/~kozyraki/).

My research centers around co-designing computer systems and architectures to improve the scalability, performance, and security of datacenter-scale applications such as machine learning.
I am currently working on designing and optimizing data storage and ingestion systems that manage training data in machine learning pipelines.
My prior research has explored accelerating video analytics pipelines and the security of cloud FPGAs.
I am supported by a [Stanford Graduate Fellowship](https://vpge.stanford.edu/fellowships-funding/sgf/details) and a [Meta PhD Fellowship](https://research.facebook.com/fellowship/).
My work is a [Top Pick in Hardware and Embedded Security](https://www.ieee-hsttc.org/top-picks-2022/) and won the [IEEE S&P Distinguished Practical Paper Award](https://www.ieee-security.org/TC/SP2018/awards.html).

I was recently a Visiting Researcher in the [FAIR](https://ai.facebook.com) and infrastructure teams at Meta from 2020-2022, where I worked on data infrastructures for ML training.
I received my B.S. in [Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://www.ece.cornell.edu/ece) from [Cornell University](https://www.cornell.edu) in 2018, where I worked with [Ed Suh](https://tsg.ece.cornell.edu/people/g-edward-suh/) on hardware security.
